## Project Description
This report provides an analysis of aviation accidents, with a review of the history and an analysis of the different operators of the world. Furthermore, we will see an evaluation of the accidents for over 70 years, divided by the phases of a flight and an analysis of forecasted aviation trends will also provide.

The goal of this report of aviation accidents is to help to understand how safe the industry is. I decided to choose that topic, because I love to travel, I usually take many planes and I wanted to check if it is really a safe transport.


## Questions & Hypotheses
Apart from trying to answer a few questions, I wanted to see if I found some interesting insights.

It is said that one of the safest transports that exist is the airline flights. Mainly, the reason for the study was to verify this statement.

Before and during the whole process of the report, I asked myself some questions that could be summarized in the following:

•	Have accidents decreased over the years? (depending on the number of flights)
•	What has been the rate of change over the last 10 years?
•	Which airlines are the most dangerous? Which ones have had more accidents in the last 10 years, and which ones have had more fatalities? What countries are these airlines from?
•	What are the forecast accidents for the next two years?
•	Have been more accidents on airlines from less developed countries? And fatalities?
•	Are there more landing accidents than take-off accidents?


## Dataset
The accidents data has been extracted from the official web “Aviation Safety Network”, which aim is to provide everyone, complete and reliable authoritative information on airliner accidents and safety issues.

## Workflow
In order to answer the questions, I started looking for databases from which to extract the information. When I had a good database, I started to familiarize myself with it, understanding it, cleaning it and therefore manipulating it.

## Organization
I did not use a anything especial to organise my project, I just use a notebook with the steps I had to follow.
